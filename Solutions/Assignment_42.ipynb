    "# The difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding lies in the nature of the categorical variables they handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label Encoding: In label encoding, each category in a categorical variable is assigned a unique integer value. The order of the categories does not matter, and the integers are assigned arbitrarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal encoding is used when the categories have an inherent order or rank. Each category is mapped to an integer value based on its order, preserving the ordinal relationship among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Suppose we have a dataset with a \"Education Level\" column containing categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" \"Master's Degree,\" and \"PhD.\" In label encoding, these categories might be assigned integers like 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. However, in ordinal encoding, the categories would be encoded based on their educational rank, such as 0 for \"High School,\" 1 for \"Bachelor's Degree,\" 2 for \"Master's Degree,\" and 3 for \"PhD.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Choosing between them depends on whether the categorical variable has a meaningful order. If the order matters, ordinal encoding is more appropriate; otherwise, label encoding can be used."

    "# Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a method of encoding categorical variables based on their relationship with the target variable. It is typically used in binary classification problems.

The categories can then be ranked based on their churn rates, and these ranks can be used as the ordinal labels.\n",
