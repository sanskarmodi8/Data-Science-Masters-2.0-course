    "# The choice of metric depends on the characteristics of your dataset and your specific goals. For predicting house prices, MAE, MSE, and RMSE are commonly used metrics. If you want to emphasize the importance of larger errors, MSE or RMSE might be more suitable. If you want to understand the average percentage deviation, MAPE could be a good choice. Additionally, using multiple metrics in conjunction can provide a more comprehensive view of model performance."
