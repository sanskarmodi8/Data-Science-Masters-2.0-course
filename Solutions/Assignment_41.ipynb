    "# Data encoding is the process of converting categorical or textual data into numerical representations to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. In data science, numerical data is easier for algorithms to process and analyze. Encoding allows us to represent categorical features in a format that can be used as input for various machine learning models."

One-hot encoding treats each category independently and creates binary columns for each category, which might not be suitable when the categories have a meaningful order.\n",

In this case, nominal encoding would be more appropriate than one-hot encoding.\n",
