    "# Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines the penalties of both Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization methods. It's designed to handle situations where there are multiple correlated features that may lead to multicollinearity issues.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression: OLS doesn't include regularization. Elastic Net, on the other hand, adds regularization terms to the loss function.\n",
    "# Ridge Regression: Ridge uses L2 regularization and is effective when there are many correlated predictors. Elastic Net introduces L1 regularization as well, which helps in feature selection.\n",
    "# Lasso Regression: Lasso uses L1 regularization and tends to perform feature selection by driving some coefficients to exactly zero. Elastic Net provides a balance between L1 and L2 regularization."
