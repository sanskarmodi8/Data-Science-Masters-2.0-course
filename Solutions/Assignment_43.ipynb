    "# To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, you need a dataset containing the study time and exam scores for each student.

    "# The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. If the coefficient is close to 1, it suggests that students who spend more time studying tend to have higher exam scores. If it is close to -1, it suggests that more study time is associated with lower exam scores. If the coefficient is close to 0, there is no significant linear relationship between study time and exam scores.\n",
